## Epic V3 — Smart input, dev tracker, richer viz (planned)

Scoped in `docs/prompts/05-platform-v3-smart-input-dev-tracker.md`. **Keep this
table and that doc in sync** (the cross-place task-sync rule applies to our docs).

| ID | Title | Status |
|---|---|---|
| V3-A | Smart input (VS Code-style completion) + duplicate corner-badge | ✅ |
| V3-B | Cross-place task sync — recurrence-instance linking + edit propagates to future occurrences (+ ↻ badge, Plan edit) | ✅ |

## Epic P — Polish: scroll, analytics, cloud (2026-06-12)

Page-by-page enhancement pass. Full audit in `docs/redesign/06-app-audit-and-enhancements.mdx`.

| ID | Title | Status |
|---|---|---|
| P-1 | Challenges 2-grid (rules+stats / calendar) + best-streak/days-left stats | ✅ |
| P-2 | Fitness compact one-line history (recent/all toggle) | ✅ |
| P-3 | Trackers Day/Week/Month view toggle | ✅ |
| P-4 | Side-by-side cards to cut scrolling (Fitness Totals+PBs, Focus stats+chart) | ✅ |
| P-5 | Cloud storage — verified: own-folder / Google Drive / GitHub gist (Settings → Data & Cloud) | ✅ |
| P-6 | Trackers category radar chart | 🔜 |

| P-8 | Passcode + client-side encryption (BUJO-90) | 🔜 |
| P-9 | Accounts + E2E cloud sync (BUJO-91, needs backend) | 🔜 |

## Epic R2 — Roadmap (scoped 2026-06-12)

Vision + full reasoning in `docs/redesign/07-space-vision-and-backlog.mdx`.

| ID | Title | Size | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| R2-1 | Passcode + client-side encryption — AES-GCM/PBKDF2 at rest, lock-screen gate, encrypt-on-save | ✅ |
| R2-2 | Monthly: habit-completion ribbon per day | S | ✅ |
| R2-3 | Insights: clickable stats → jump to source (nav context) | S | ✅ |
| R2-4 | Stats: activity-heatmap range picker (3/6/12mo) | S | ✅ |
| R2-5 | Shared `StatTile` + `ChartCard` primitives (de-dup) | S | 🔜 |
| R2-6 | Drag-and-drop: **reorder habits** (native DnD on a grip) | M | ✅ |
| R2-7 | Unified cross-view goal system | M | 🔜 |
| R2-8 | Smarter notifications (streak-at-risk, challenge day) | M | ✅ |
| R2-9 | Accent-color picker (Settings → Journal feel) | M | ✅ |
| R2-10 | Accounts + E2E-encrypted cloud sync (needs backend) | L | 🔜 |
| R2-11 | Chart a11y text-alternatives (key charts) — axe-core CI deferred | M | ◑ |

**Still open after this run** (each merits its own focused session, not a rushed
end-of-marathon patch):
- **R2-5** — extract `StatTile`/`ChartCard` from the ~dozen ad-hoc stat/chart
  blocks. Pure refactor; touches many files, so do it deliberately.
- **R2-7** — a unified goal model (one `Goal` type spanning habits, challenges,
  fitness, focus) with a cross-view roll-up. Genuine feature design needed.
- **R2-10** — accounts + E2E cloud sync **needs a backend**; out of the
  local-first scope. R2-1's at-rest crypto is the client half of this.
- **R2-11 tail** — full chart sweep + `axe-core` CI job (needs CI wiring).

## Epic PDF/UX — coaching content + mobile + hosting (shipped)

Driven by the user's workout PDFs + a stream of UX asks. All ✅ on `main`
(mobile on `feat/mobile-view`).

| # | What | Status |
|---|---|---|
| P-01 | Encode 12-week hypertrophy program (generic) + pull-up workout library + progression library | ✅ |
| P-02 | Move exercise anatomy to the right rail | ✅ |
| P-03 | Progress-photo tracker (dated upload, gallery, first-vs-latest compare) | ✅ |
| P-04 | Settings: denser unit grid + "Your data at a glance" | ✅ |
| P-05 | Stats: clearer mood calendar (purpose, legend, avg/best) | ✅ |
| P-06 | Anime-style training penalties (300-drill tiered catalogue, severity from skips) | ✅ |
| P-07 | Fitness: compact 6-tile metrics + history on the right | ✅ |
| P-08 | Dedicated Pull-ups view; pull-up cards & program moved out of Gym | ✅ |
| P-09 | Plan: migration sort (Date/Priority), 2-col grid, priority star | ✅ |
| P-10 | Nutrition: American+Indian food DB → macro auto-sum, sample day, online lookup | ✅ |
| P-11 | Voice input (Web Speech) on quick-add | ✅ |
| P-12 | Trainer/physio form-cue + injury-watch per exercise | ✅ |
| P-13 | GitHub-pages `prose-doc` readable typography + expanded Help | ✅ |
| P-14 | Shared `StatTile`/`ChartCard`/`ProgramTracker` primitives (de-dup) | ✅ |
| P-15 | Merge all work → `main`; GitHub Pages deploy workflow + `DATA_MODEL.md` | ✅ |
| P-16 | Mobile bottom tab bar (`feat/mobile-view`) | ✅ |

**Notes / still open:**
- GitHub Pages must be enabled once: *Repo → Settings → Pages → Build and
  deployment: GitHub Actions*.
- A true server-backed account/sync (R2-10) remains out of local-first scope.
- "Use the web to calculate" nutrition is a search-link + offline DB; a live
  USDA/FoodData API integration would need an API key (future).

## Epic ADV — advanced views, viz, contacts (shipped)

| # | What | Status |
|---|---|---|
| A-01 | R2-11 tail: aria-labels on remaining Gym/Cycle charts | ✅ |

| A-05 | Motion: staggered entrance + 3D hover/press (reduced-motion-aware) | ✅ |
| A-06 | **Friends/contacts** collection + opt-in GitHub public-profile enrich | ✅ |
| A-07 | Docs/prompts pass (FEATURES/DECISIONS/DATA_MODEL/WORKLOG + prompt template) | ✅ |

### Epic ADV-2 — progress log (appended; do not overwrite)

Charts shipped: ✅ calorie trend, ✅ macro rings, ✅ body-weight moving avg,
✅ mood-by-weekday, ✅ workout-split donut, ✅ focus cumulative hours,
✅ year-in-pixels, ✅ RPE effort trend (8/10).
Charts deferred as already-covered: per-habit year heatmap (drawer has 12-week),
PR timeline (Personal records card exists).

Features shipped: ✅ CSV export per section (entries/habits/metrics/workouts).
Also shipped beyond the list: ✅ Daily coverage summary (yesterday + week),
✅ storage-quota meter/guard, ✅ PRODUCT_GAPS.md (Path A roadmap).

Features still open (medium/large — benefit from a steer):
print/PDF view · Insights filters · habit-archive browser · friend-birthday →
Future-Log · weekly-review wizard · quick-add templates · tag manager ·
CSV import · configurable Today dashboard.

### Epic ADV-2 — progress log #2 (appended)

Features shipped: ✅ tag manager (rename/merge), ✅ print/Save-as-PDF,
✅ quick-add templates, ✅ archived-habits browser, ✅ friend birthdays + countdown,
✅ Insights search type-filters, ✅ configurable Today dashboard, ✅ guided weekly review.
Deferred: CSV import (⊘ — JSON import already restores; generic CSV is schema-ambiguous).

Structural: ✅ **Merged Fitness + Gym** into one tabbed hub (Cardio | Strength),
dropping a duplicate nav item; Gym lazy-loads per tab and stays deep-linkable.
Also: ✅ comprehensive `docs/FEATURE_GUIDE.md` (every view/sub-feature, 5+ lines).

ADV-2 tally: 8/10 charts (2 covered by existing UI), 9/10 features (1 deferred).

### Epic ADV-2 — closeout (appended)

Charts 9/10: ✅ calorie trend · macro rings · body-weight avg · mood-by-weekday ·
workout-split · focus cumulative · year-in-pixels · RPE trend · per-habit year
heatmap. PR timeline = covered by the Personal-Records card (not rebuilt).
Features 10/10: ✅ tag manager · print/PDF · quick-add templates · archive browser ·
friend birthdays · Insights filters · configurable Today dashboard · weekly review ·
CSV export · **CSV import**.
Plus beyond-list: Today's-plan hub, dedup (birthdays/Fitness+Gym/dead code),
5-tab bottom nav, iOS drawer, contextual help, card-ordering pass (D-35),
IndexedDB photos, onboarding, graphify install. **Task #40 closed.**

## Epic SYNC-FB-HABIT — session 2026-06-15 (appended)

Three features shipped in one working session, plus follow-ups queued.

| ID | Title | Status |
|---|---|---|
| BUJO-146 | Cloud-sync conflict resolution — prompt before clobbering unsynced local edits (`resolveIncoming` + `updatedAt` stamp) | ✅ |
| BUJO-147 | In-app feedback widget → files a GitHub issue (anonymous serverless `/api/feedback`, honeypot + rate limit) | ✅ |
| BUJO-148 | Habit metric types: `timer` (minutes) + `rating` (1–5), additive to `check`/`count` | ✅ |
| BUJO-149 | Habit **activity-heatmap** layout + classic/activity switcher (persisted in `Settings.trackerLayout`) | ✅ |
| BUJO-150 | Expanded habit presets (timer/rating examples: Run, Stretch, Focus, Mood, Energy, Steps, Coffee, Vitamins, Journal, No sugar) | ✅ |
| BUJO-151 | Drag-to-reorder in the activity view (classic-grid only today; rows honor saved `order`) | 🔜 |
| BUJO-152 | Guest (view-only) + Google sign-in (secure storage) auth split, with per-page data security model | 🔜 |

Shared internals: `habitDoneOn` / `habitValueOn` / `habitIntensity` / `habitTarget` /
`nextHabitValue` extracted to `stats.ts` as the single source of truth so completion,
streaks, consistency, weekday-breakdown, and the activity heatmap all agree across
layouts. Pre-existing stats fns (`habitStreak`, `habitConsistency`, `weeklyHabitCount`,
`habitDayOfWeekBreakdown`, `reminderMessage`) rewired to honor numeric types.

Audit (3 reviewers): fixed timer-cycle skipping non-divisible targets (was making such
habits permanently incompletable), numeric-habit blind spots in reminders + weekday
breakdown, triple-duplicated step logic, and a11y labels on the activity strip/stars/toggle.

## Epic UX-2 — session 2026-06-15 cont. (appended)

| BUJO-155 | Settings layout redesign — designed header + sticky icon sidebar rail (desktop) / scroll row (mobile) + grouped account/sync/privacy section | ✅ |

## Epic CAPTURE-UX — session 2026-06-16 (appended)

| BUJO-164 | Mobile Trackers sticky habit-name column overflow/overlap fix | ✅ (#17) |
| BUJO-165 | **Habit polarity** — build vs avoid/quit (alcohol/smoking/sugar): slip/clean semantics, `cleanStreak`, red/Ban UI in all surfaces; dedup guard | ✅ (#18) |
| BUJO-166 | Activity "cube" cells made interactive (were read-only → looked broken for check habits) | ✅ (#18) |
| BUJO-167 | Reuse existing units (same-unit consistency datalist) | ✅ (#19) |
